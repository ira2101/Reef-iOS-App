# Reef-iOS-App

Reef is an app where users can have anonymous conversations with each other. The app is anonymous so that everyone can feel comfortable in sharing their thoughts. This also helps to put everyone on equal footing and to help people form their own opinions.

This is an older version. Working on the latest version of the app now in a private repository, but still wanted to showcase some of my iOS programming skills here!
